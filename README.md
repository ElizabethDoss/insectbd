# Insect Biodiversity
This is an analysis of the Copenhagen Zoological Museum's light trap insect data. Original data is included in the insects.csv file and includes order, family, genus, and species along with collection dates and number of individuals caught. This trap focused on Lepidoptera (butterflies & moths) and Coleoptera (beetles). For this project I am attempting to demonstrate a variety of data analysis tools as part of an ongoing data science education. This data set was selected because as an ecologist, biodiversity in insects is an important metric to me, and this provides an excellent example of diversity over time.
